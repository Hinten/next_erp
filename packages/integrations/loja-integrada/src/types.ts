/**
 * Loja Integrada REST v1 wire schemas — RESPONSE shapes only, and only the ones
 * something consumes today: the Tastypie paging envelope, the categoria row
 * (the validating GET lists categorias) and the pedido search row (the order
 * poller, master-plan step 3).
 *
 * Every other resource (the pedido detail, situação, produto, estoque, preço,
 * imagem, marca, grades, envio, pagamento) arrives with its first consumer,
 * written against captured responses rather than the public document's
 * examples.
 *
 * ## Passthrough
 *
 * Every object is `.passthrough()`: Loja Integrada adds fields without notice,
 * and a schema that stripped them would hide exactly the drift a later step
 * needs to see.
 *
 * ## Numbers
 *
 * ⚠️ This file and `pedidoTipos.ts` are the only ones under `src/` that use Zod
 * for numbers, and every one goes through `wireInt()` / `wireNumber()` from
 * `@delfrance/core/wire`: a serializer that quotes ONE field must not cost the
 * whole page (#1087).
 * Enforced by
 * `packages/config-eslint/rules/integration-response-numbers-tolerant.test.js`,
 * which scans every file under `src/` and anchors on three lines of this file.
 * ⚠️ Keep each anchored field on its own short line, so Prettier never wraps it
 * out of the guard's line-based scan.

 * `next` / `previous` are RELATIVE paths under `/api/v1/…`, never followed
 * verbatim — `paginacao.ts` takes only their query string.

/**
 * One row of `GET /v1/pedido/search` as the order poller reads it: only what it
 * decides on, everything else kept by `.passthrough()`. The poller never maps
 * an order (the importer re-fetches it by `numero`, D13).
 *
 *  - `numero`: the order key, a JSON number or a quoted one (`wireInt()`). A
 *    row without it costs the page, because nothing can be enqueued for it.
 *  - `data_modificacao`: deliberately `z.unknown().optional()`. Its shape is
 *    canonicalised by the app (`lerDataLi`), which turns anything unexpected —
 *    an absent key included — into a per-row `formato-de-data`: one odd stamp
 *    must never cost the whole page, or the other rows on it would not be
 *    enqueued either. ⚠️ The `.optional()` is load-bearing: Zod 4 rejects an
 *    ABSENT key under a bare `z.unknown()` (`expected nonoptional`), which
 *    would fail the page for one row.
 *
 * ⚠️ `numero` passes here as ANY safe integer, zero and negatives included; the
 * task payload's grammar (`numeroPedidoLiSchema`, positive decimal) is checked
 * where the payload is built.
 *
 * Written first against the public document's two example rows, then
 * CONFIRMED by the owner's C1 captures (the `pedido-search-*` fixtures of
 * `apps/loja-integrada`): every captured row passes it, its `data_modificacao`
 * is already a canonical stamp, and the filtered search lists no row below the
 * bound it was sent — pinned by
 * `apps/loja-integrada/lib/lojaIntegrada/pedidos/capturasBusca.test.ts`.
 * ⚠️ The captured rows come ordered by `numero`, NOT by `data_modificacao`;
 * the poller deliberately assumes no order (its cursor is the max stamp over
 * the whole drain).
